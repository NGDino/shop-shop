## Description

* Shop shop is a Ecommerce platform created for an assignement during my Full Stack coding bootcamp through UC Berkeley.  It uses MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, and stripe. This assignment was to refactor an existing webpage to have a global state to control the data for the categories, products and shopping cart.  In addition, to the refactor I also added in the abilitiy to check out with stripe and offline capabilities with IndexedDB.

* You can view the deployed site at [https://colossal-closer.herokuapp.com/](https://colossal-closer.herokuapp.com/).
